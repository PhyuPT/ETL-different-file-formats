There are several steps in Data Engineering process.

**Extract** - Data extraction is getting data from multiple sources. Ex. Data extraction from a website using Web scraping or gathering information from the data that are stored in different formats(JSON, CSV, XLSX etc.).

**Transform** - Transforming the data means removing the data that we don't need for further analysis and converting the data in the format that all the data from the multiple sources is in the same format.

**Load** - load a dataset into our Jupyter Notebook - Loading the data inside a data warehouse. Data warehouse essentially contains large volumes of data that are accessed to gather insights.

Working with different file formats. There are various formats for a dataset, .csv, .json, .xlsx etc
1. Reading data using Pandas Library
2. Transform Function in Pandas
3. Visualization
